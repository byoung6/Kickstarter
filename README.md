### Kickstarting with Excel

1. Overview of Project

Louise's play has come close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time, and now wants to understand how different variables in past campaigns have impacted the viability of Louise's play _Fever_. The purpose of the attached to to provide visual representations of approximately 1500 campaign outcomes based on launch dates and funding goals. 

2. Analysis 

The two deliverables provide information given the data provided. 

    2.a. Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Dates

The first deliverable, Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Dates looks at the per month rates of sucess, failure, and cancellations within the given data set.

As we see, the data represents a higher number of campaign success in May, tapering off for the rest of the year. Further, failed campaigns represent a consistent rate throughout a calendar year. Cancellations within the data set are fairly consistent across the board.
    
        2.b. Outcomes Based on Goals
    
The second deliverable, Outcomes Based on Goals, represents the correlation, in the data, between the potential of success to the amount money under the "Goal" category. The data itself was built using the following functions:
![Countifs function](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76926631/137231830-1e9baf33-3cf0-4d8f-8fc6-95318f47ed2e.PNG), 
![Summation Function](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76926631/137231856-6e4a8346-8d58-4e0f-b590-ff719eef1bc6.PNG), and

Oddly enough, there was an inverse correlation in the data between amount of money per campaign goal, and likelihood of success, up to the 25,000 to 24,999 range.

3. Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

There were no challenges or difficulties encountered. Some difficulties that may arise are basic syntax errors and dragging of cell fields, modifying source data. This can be resolved by reviewing the code, and checking to see if the correct source data is consistent. 

4. Results

- Two conclusions that can be drawn about the Outcomes based on Launch Date

Two solutions that can be drawn about Outcomes based on Launch Date are: 1) May campaigns have the most amount of campaigns and numerically, have the highest number of successful campaigns. If we want to find out the highest likelihood of success, we would have to find the percentage of sucessful campaigns over the grand total. 2) Cancellations within the data set are fairly consistent throughout the year. 

-  Outcomes based on Goals?

We can conclude from the data provided that higher Goal money does not necessarily contribute to a higher likelihood of success. 

- Limitations of this dataset

Limitations of the data set do not show rates of outcomes, nor can it provide information for prediction models. 

- Some other possible tables and/or graphs

Possible tables and/or graphs that can be created that would be of use would be
